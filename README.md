## About this project
This project was, again, made for learning purposes. But now, I want to focus my skills on Laravel + VueJS. That is why I want to
focus myself on the design of this project, and test some VueJS 2.0 functionality. All the design is made by myself, and I'm 
trying to organize my SCSS in a clean way. Here is an exemple of a custom component I've made in VueJS, which handle the 
login / register flow
